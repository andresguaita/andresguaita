### Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Andres Guaita
#### Backend Developer

I am a Telecommunications Technologist and Backend Developer with over 4 years of experience in IT, including more than 3 years as a Software Developer. My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Node JS, Express, NestJS, Postgres, MongoDB, Serverless Framework, Amazon Web Services (Cognito, Lambda, SNS, DynamoDB), Google Cloud Provider (Cloud SQL, App Engine, Cloud Functions), Ruby, and many other relevant technologies in the field.

I am passionate about developing innovative and challenging solutions that propel my career to the next level. As an IT professional, I have a special interest in the FinTech world and its potential to transform the financial sector.

Throughout my career, I have successfully taken developments from inception to the successful deployment of the application in production. Today, these APIs are operational, handling thousands of requests daily.

If you have a challenge for a highly qualified Backend developer with assertive communication skills and up-to-date knowledge in IT technologies, who is always in constant learning, I would love to discuss any interesting opportunity that allows me to contribute to the business and enhance my career.
